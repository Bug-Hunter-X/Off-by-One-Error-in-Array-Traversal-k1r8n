# Off-by-One Error in Java Array

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The error occurs because the loop condition incorrectly includes the index equal to the array's length, which is out of bounds.

The `Bug.java` file shows the buggy code, while `BugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of carefully checking loop conditions when working with arrays in Java or any other programming language.
